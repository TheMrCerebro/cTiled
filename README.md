# cTiled
Load TMX files created with Tiled into the Cerberus X
These functions are used to load TMX files created with the Tiled map editor (www.mapeditor.org). With few
lines of code you can show complex maps or if you prefer use all the variables to create complex things.

Examples:

<b>Basic</b> - It contains a very basic example of how a TMX file is loaded and how the data is used to
draw a map with all its layers and tilesets.

<b>Animation</b> - It is a simple example of how you can create animations with tiles, as well as how the
tileset is used externally (TSX files). It can be done in many ways.

<b>Properties</b> - This example shows how to extract the properties of the objects. Properties can be
present in "layers", "tileset" and many others. They contain information added by the user.

<b>Shapes</b> - The objects can have many shapes to be used on the map. The most common is the
rectangle but you can use others such as ellipses, points or even create polygons. In this example I
visually show what shapes it has and how they could be used.

<b>Tilesets</b> - This example shows how several different tileset can be used on the same map to add
more images, effects or animations.


Too easy!
